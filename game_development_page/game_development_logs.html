          <p class = "gameText">I implemented some of the basic features to the
            game such as player movement and a bullet spawner that is meant to
            be added to a future enemy AI that would shoot arrows at the main
            player. I referenced the concept from the following unity

          <p class = "gameText">With the help of Brackeys and A star path finding
            I was able to create a simple enemy that follows the player. I tried
            to use the AI implemented from the A* path finding project but, it
            is limited to a Birdseye type of 2D game rather then a 2D Sidescroller.
            When I tried to tweak it to work for a Sidescroller I faced issues
            with the AI shifting along the z axis during collisions. It might be
            because I’m creating a 3D game with 2D physics, so I created my own
            AI script following Brackeys tutorial.

          <h4 class = "gameTitle"> 2018-10-02 : Modified the enemy AI Script </h4>
          <p class = "gameText">I ran into an issue with the AI as even when the
            target was reached the target continued to ‘shimmey’ and force its way
            closer then I wanted the enemy to approach the player. Also when two
            enemy’s were next to each other the further one pushes the enemy in
            front to reach the player. To solve this I modified Bradley’s AI
            script to include a circle collider to detect when the target or
            another AI is reached. Thus in the script utilizing onTriggerEnter2D
            and onTriggerExit2D to edit a Boolean to determine whether or not to
            move the AI.

          <h4 class = "gameTitle"> 2018-10-03 : Modified Enemy AI Script V2 (Multiple Colliders) </h4>
          <p class = "gameText">Edited the AI to only chase the player when it
            is within the vision radius (circle collider) of the enemy and stopping
            the movement of the AI when it is inside the Attack radius (another
            circle collider). This was done by adding empty game objects; one for
            vision and one for attack. Respectively adding a circle collider and
            a script to each of the children of the enemy AI. From there I used
            onTriggerEnter2D and onTriggerExit2D like before to determine when it
            enters and leaves one of the colliders. Then within the EnemyAI script
            I referred to the two scripts to determine when I should move the enemy.

            </br>
            Revised: When I put in multiple enemies into the scene using prefabs
            the enemies all referred to the same colliders on only of the enemies.
            To fix this I referred to each scripts individually by looking into
            the children of the AI gameObject rather then looking for the scripts
            in the entire game like in the first method.
